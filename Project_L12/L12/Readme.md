The answer to the question of exercise 1, step 5: Do you have signals indicating that the S sequence contains an exon-intron border?

Since several sliding windows have positive log-likelihood (log-odds) scores, especially the high-scoring windows at positions 10 (AACGTAATC) and 1 (CAGGTTGGA), the sequence S contains subsequences that match the exon–intron boundary motif better than what would be expected by random background DNA. This indicates that sequence S likely contains an exon–intron border signal, with the strongest candidate located near the window starting at position 10.
